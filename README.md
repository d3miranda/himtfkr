Mapping virtual environment to better feel virtually-induced altered states of consciousness

The way different environments can be represented in the brain are not that important for most of the humans. However, an unsignificant part of them think about the possibility to merge functionaly natural and virtual environmental maps in the brain. Such an unuseful task would allow in the future for smoother transitions between natural- and virtual-induced mindsets. Here, we propose the use of classic psychedelics associated to listening of good and viscereal jazzy afrobeat grooves to allow for fuller, faster and smoother transitions between natural- and virtual-induced mindsets.
